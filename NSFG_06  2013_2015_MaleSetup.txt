*
*
*  SPSS setup sections are provided for the ASCII version of this data
*  collection.  These sections are listed below:
*
*  DATA LIST:  assigns the name, type, decimal specification (if any),
*  and specifies the beginning and ending column locations for each
*  variable in the data file. Users must replace the "data-filename"
*  in the DATA LIST statement with a filename specifying the directory
*  on the user's computer system in which the downloaded and unzipped
*  data file is physically located (e.g., "c:\temp\data.dat").
*
*  VARIABLE LABELS:  assigns descriptive labels to all variables.
*  Labels and variable names may be identical for some data files.
*
*  VALUE LABELS: assigns descriptive labels to codes found in the data
*  file.  Not all codes necessarily have assigned value labels.
*
*  CREATING A PERMANENT SPSS DATA FILE: If users wish to create and save
*  an SPSS data file for further analysis using SPSS for Windows, the
*  necessary "SAVE OUTFILE" command is provided in the last line of
*  this file.  To activate the command, users must delete the leading
*  asterisk (*) and replace "spss-filename" with a filename specifying
*  the location on the user's computer system to which the new data file
*  will be saved (e.g., SAVE OUTFILE="c:\spsswin\data\NSFG-datafile.sav").
